- 👋 Hi, I’m @schueppe
- 👀 I’m interested in web-development, medical and biological data sience/ML.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python for data sience (mainly using sklearn, matplotlib, pandas and numpy).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on medical or biological data sience projects, to learn more about how to use data sience for sientific projects.
